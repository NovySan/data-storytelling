The Johnny Carson Center for Emerging Media Arts at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln is excited to present the Data Storytelling Workshop & Data Art Jam on January 13, 2025. This unique event will bring together scientists, artists, technologists, and storytellers for a day of creative exploration where data meets storytelling and art comes alive.

Organized by the UNL "CreatiViz" team, the event aims to cultivate a culture of creative data visualization by transforming complex datasets into compelling visual narratives. Participants will engage in hands-on workshops, interactive data experiences, and an open art jam that celebrates the intersection of technology, creativity, information, and human expression. Through these activities, attendees will learn to weave narratives around data, employing visualizations, interactive applications, and real-world experiences to convey insights in an engaging and accessible way.

In today's data-rich, rapidly evolving landscape, the ability to effectively communicate insights derived from complex datasets is crucial. The Data Storytelling Workshop & Data Art Jam merges the rigor of data analysis with the creativity of storytelling, offering a powerful tool for conveying complex ideas to diverse audiences. Attendees will discover how to transform raw data into visual representations—such as attractive charts, engaging graphs, and interactive simulations—that inform, engage, inspire, and provoke curiosity.

This hands-on event will not only reinforce learning but also cultivate critical thinking skills, inspire curiosity, and promote informed decision-making in society. Through innovative storytelling techniques and engaging data experience design, we aim to provide a vibrant journey into the world of creative data visualization and physicalization.
